 Docker image is a static, read-only template (blueprint) containing application code and dependencies, while a container is a runnable, mutable, and active instance of that image. Images are stored in registries and are immutable, whereas containers are lightweight, ephemeral runtime environments, often described as a "running" vs "stored" state. 

Key Differences Between Containers and Images


State: Images are immutable (unchangeable) snapshots. Containers are mutable and live, storing runtime changes in a writable layer.
Purpose: Images are used for storing and shipping applications. Containers are used for running and testing applications.
Storage: Images are saved as files on disk. Containers exist in system RAM.
Relationship: One image can be used to launch multiple, independent containers.
Components: Images are made of read-only layers. Containers consist of an image layer plus a thin, writable container layer. 


Summary Analogy
Image: The recipe or the blueprint.
Container: The cake made from the recipe or the building constructed from the blueprint.
